# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SER-
This was a small mini project made in my undergraduate degree. SER is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech, using an MLP classifier model and the RAVDESS dataset. The RAVDESS dataset has 7356 files rated by 247 individuals 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness.
