# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SER-
This was a small mini project made in my undergraduate degree. Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. It is difficult because emotions are subjective and annotating audio is challenging. To build a model to recognize emotion from speech, librosa and sklearn libraries and the RAVDESS dataset are used. The RAVDESS dataset has 7356 files rated by 247 individuals 10 times on emotional validity, intensity, and genuineness.
